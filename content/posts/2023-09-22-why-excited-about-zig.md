## A Go programmer‚Äôs perspective on Zig

For the past few years, I‚Äôve been a happy user of Go, my main programming language alongside Python. I‚Äôve also written my fair share of Pascal, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and I‚Äôve been toying with Rust, Erlang, TypeScript, Ruby, R, Dart, Lua, Clojure, and OCaml.

Recently, I‚Äôve been looking at [Zig](https://ziglang.org/), a new and promising programming language, still in development, but already used with great success in ambitious projects like [Bun](https://bun.sh/), a JavaScript runtime and toolkit, [TigerBeetle](https://tigerbeetle.com/), a financial accounting database, and [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/), a terminal emulator.

I‚Äôm pretty excited about Zig. But it made we wonder why I would use Zig instead of Go, considering that Go has served me well so far. ü§î That‚Äôs what I hope to clarify by writing this post.

I need to mention upfront that I don‚Äôt think there is a perfect programming language. This post is about discussing the tradeoffs I‚Äôm seeing, not claiming that one language is superior to another. ‚ù§Ô∏è

## ‚ö°Ô∏è The joy of programming the computer, not the language

I think my interest for Zig comes down to a simple idea: With Zig, I‚Äôm rediscovering *the joy of programming in a minimalist low-level language like C*, but *with most of the perks of a modern high-level language*.

There is something refreshing about being able to write programs interacting directly with the hardware and the OS, skipping the middlemen: no interpreter, no JIT compiler, no VM, no runtime, no garbage collector, no user-space scheduler.

## üî¨ Comparing Zig and Go

### Zig == Go

Let‚Äôs start with what Go and Zig have in common. They both are general-purpose, imperative, statically typed, ahead-of-time compiled, and relatively simple programming languages, with a built-in code formatter, test runner, and cross-compiler.

### Zig > Go

Now let‚Äôs look at some of the key features of Zig that don‚Äôt exist in Go:

- Comptime (compile-time metaprogramming)
- Explicit memory management using custom allocators and `defer/errdefer` to free memory
- Excellent error handling (using error values, `try`, `catch`, `errdefer`, and Error Return Traces)
- Immutable variables (using `const`)
- Optional types (no null pointers/references)
- Sum types (tagged unions) with exhaustive switch
- if/for/while/switch expressions
- Anonymous struct and tuple literals (automatically coerced to the destination type)
- Seamless interoperability with C, with no FFI overhead, and built-in C compiler
- Reusable code (important for bare metal, embedded, libraries, WebAssembly) enabled by:
    - No hidden memory allocations
    - No hidden control flow (like panic/restore)
    - No runtime
    - Fully optional standard library

### Zig ‚â† Go

Now let‚Äôs look at the key areas where Go and Zig do things differently:

- **Generics ‚Üí Comptime.** Go supports generic programming using type parameters since Go 1.18. Zig has comptime, a new and powerful form of compile-time metaprogramming.
- **Run-time reflection ‚Üí Compile-time reflection.** Go offers run-time reflection, via the reflect package. It is used for formatting and serialization/deserialization. Zig‚Äôs solution is based on compile-time reflection, and compile-time metaprogramming.
- **Goroutines ‚Üí Native threads & async/await.** Go relies on goroutines for concurrency and parallelism. Zig offers native threads, and ‚Äúcolourblind‚Äù async/await (momentarily unavailable in Zig 0.11) [^1]
- **Variadic arguments ‚Üí Anonymous tuple literals.** Go supports variadic arguments to function calls:
  ```
  fmt.Printf("%v + %v = %v\n", 1, 10, 11)
  ```
  Zig uses anonymous tuple literals to solve the same problem:
  ```
  std.debug.print("{} + {} = {}\n", .{1, 10, 11});
  ````

### Zig < Go

But nothing comes for free. Zig has:

- **No temporal memory safety** (no garbage collector or borrow checker), which means a higher risk of use-after-free and double-free errors.
- No closures. Closures are anonymous functions capturing variables defined in the enclosing scope. They are typically implemented using some form of automatic memory management, not present in Zig because this would defeat the goals of the language. [^2]
- No interfaces (or traits in Rust). Use `anytype`.
- A syntax that occasionally feels a bit awkward (to me at least):
    - Struct declarations where fields are separated by commas while declarations are terminated by semicolons. ([example](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/00f42909adf23a92905aa7211d74ed5b5397b397/lib/std/mem/Allocator.zig#L13))
