title: Every programming language needs its killer app to succeed
---

Every successful product has a clear purpose, a reason to exist, a unique value proposition that addresses an important pain point. 

A programming language is no different: it needs a killer app that drives adoption and overcomes resistance to change.

## Testing the theory

To test this theory, I put together a short list of popular and emerging programming languages and tried to summarize their *raison d'Ãªtre* in a few words. Interestingly, most are backed by major companies with a vested interest in the language's success. The others are supported by highly active and committed user communities.

Here is the list:

- Statically typed languages:
    - **C** â†’ Replace assembly in Unix (Bell Labs)
    - **C++** â†’ C with OOP (Bell Labs)
    - **Java** â†’ Portable, garbage collected alternative to C++ (Sun)
    - **C#** â†’ Microsoft's own Java (Microsoft)
    - **Go** â†’ Write servers and tools at Google scale (Google)
    - **Rust** â†’ Memory safety with zero overhead (Mozilla)
    - **Dart** â†’ Multi-platform apps with Flutter (Google)
    - **Kotlin** â†’ Modern Java for Android (JetBrains)
    - **Swift** â†’ Modern Objective-C for iOS and macOS (Apple)
    - **Zig** â†’ Replace C with a modern and safer language
- Dynamically typed languages:
    - **Python** â†’ Scripting language for web apps, tools, scientific computing and ML (CWI, CNRI)
    - **JavaScript** â†’ Scripting language for the web browser (Netscape)
    - **TypeScript** â†’ JavaScript with type safety (Microsoft)
    - **Ruby** â†’ "True object-oriented" scripting language, popularized by Rails
    - **PHP** â†’ Web pages
    - **Lua** â†’ Embeddable scripting language (PUC-Rio)
    - **R** â†’ Statistics (University of Auckland)

*Note: This list should ideally include other great languages such as OCaml, F#, Haskell, Scala, Lisp, Clojure, Julia, D, Nim, Erlang, Elixir, Gleam, Fortran, Ada, Perl, and more. But I ran out of time â€” so I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader.* ðŸ™‚

## Takeaway

These languages all have something in common: a clear and compelling reason to exist. They weren't invented in a vacuum. Each one solves a real problem, serves a distinct niche, or enables something that wasn't practical before.

So the next time a new language shows up on your radar, ask yourself: what's its killer app?
